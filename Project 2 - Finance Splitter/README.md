Expense Split Calculator
This project is an expense-splitting calculator that allows users to divide a total amount evenly or unevenly among a specified number of people, with an option to set custom split percentages for each person.

Features
Even Split: Splits the total amount equally among all participants.
Uneven Split: Allows each person to pay a different share based on specified percentages.
Error Handling: Ensures valid input for number of people, percentages, and amount to avoid miscalculations.
Currency Customization: The currency symbol can be customized (default is set to INR).

How to Use
Run the Script: Open and execute the script in a Python environment.
Input Required Information:
Total amount of the expense
Number of people sharing the expense
Specify whether you want an even or uneven split:
For an even split, the script will calculate each person's equal share.
For an uneven split, input the percentage each person will pay (ensuring the total adds up to 100%).
Review the Split Summary: The script will display each personâ€™s share along with the total expense and the number of people involved.

Example
Even Split

Uneven Split
Enter the total amount of the expense: 1000
Enter the number of people sharing the expense: 3

Enter the split percentages for 3 people (must add up to 100):
Enter percentage for person 1: 40

Enter percentage for person 3: 25

Person 1 should pay: INR 400.00 (40%)
Person 2 should pay: INR 350.00 (35%)
